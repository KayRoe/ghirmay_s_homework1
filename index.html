                <h2>Quatro</h2>

                <p>Quarto is a soda drink that existed in the 80s, from 1982 to 1989. It was created by Coca Cola in the British marketing, targeting a younger demographic with the branding of being the drink of the “future”, along with the futuristic theme commercial that aired in 1985.</p>
